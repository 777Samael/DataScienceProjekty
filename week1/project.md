# Data

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

Unfortunately, due to the corruption of the original data, it is recommended to use the processed data at the moment as stated in original repository.

Please split randomly data into train (90%) and test (10%). Describe what is train and test dataset. How to deal with empty values. 

# Goal

* You need to train at least ONE classifiers and compare them.
* The data used in the example code is different to the original one (which can be
found in the UCI machine learning repository). Your code needs to work with the
original data.

# Report (what i want to)

* Scientific Background (“Scientific background of the project”)
* Goal (“Goal of the project”)
* Data and Preprocessing (“Description of the data and the data-preprocessing steps”)
    * Columns description
    * Data exploration
* Methods (“Description of the used method(s)”)
    * Linear regression (try, may not work, tell why) ?
    * Random forrest\tree ?
    * Metrics (accuracy, what is?)
* Results
* Discussion (“Why is this a typical project for a data-scientist? (Or why not?)”)



If any step takes to much time, just write it in the report (explain why).
